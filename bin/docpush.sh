# A script to push the javadocs to github. You must have permission
# to push changes to the jtk repository. If you have not set up some
# SSH authentication, then pushing the javadocs to github will prompt
# you to enter your github username and password. 
# 
# The recommended option is to use SSH over the HTTPS port:
#   https://help.github.com/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port
# Another option is to generate an SSH key and add it to github:
#   https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
#
# NOTE: This script assumes git is on your PATH and that the
#       javadocs have already been generated by running ant with
#       the 'doc' target.
